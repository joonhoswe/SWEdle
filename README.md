# ðŸ’« About:
ðŸ§© SWEdle is a spinoff of the viral web game Wordle.com. Instead of random words, SWEdle incorporates various Software Engineering words and terms, such as "React", "Linux", "Agile", etc. As of now, it only incorporates a list of 5 letter words, similar to Wordle. <br><br>

## Â ðŸŽ® Game Images:

## ðŸš€ Future Plans:
- Incorporate Web Scraping to scrape websites and dictionaries with lists of SWE words
- Connect the scraped terms to a database
- Expand the game to allow for various lengths of SWE words, not just 5 letter words.
